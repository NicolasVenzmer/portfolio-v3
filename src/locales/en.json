    "bio": "I'm a Full Stack Engineer with a background in Information Technology Management, building modern, scalable web applications from end to end. Over the past 4+ years, I've worked across frontend and backend, turning complex business requirements into reliable, high-quality digital products. I've contributed to cloud-based applications using React, Next.js, Node.js, and AWS, collaborating closely with designers, backend engineers, data teams, and stakeholders to deliver secure and performant solutions. From building API-driven platforms and automation tools to implementing authentication systems and CI/CD pipelines, I enjoy owning features across the full development lifecycle. My journey started in data architecture, which shaped the way I think about systems: scalable, structured, and designed for long-term impact. Today, I focus on building products that not only work — but create real value for users and businesses. Fluent in English and Spanish, I'm driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and the challenge of building technology that solves meaningful problems.",
